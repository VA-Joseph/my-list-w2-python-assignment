# Week 2 Python Assignment â€“ List Operations

## Description

This project is part of the Week 2 assignment for the Python programming course. The task involves performing a series of operations on a list to demonstrate understanding of Python list methods and indexing.

## Objectives

- Create and modify lists in Python
- Use common list methods such as `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `index()`
- Gain hands-on experience with basic data structures

## Instructions

The Python script performs the following steps:

1. Creates an empty list named `my_list`
2. Appends the values 10, 20, 30, and 40
3. Inserts the value 15 at the second position
4. Extends the list with additional values `[50, 60, 70]`
5. Removes the last element from the list
6. Sorts the list in ascending order
7. Finds and prints the index of the value 30

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `week2_assignment.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the file with the following command:

   ```bash
   python week2_assignment.py
   ```

## What I Learned

- How to create and manipulate Python lists
- The difference between `append()` and `extend()`
- How to use `insert()` to place elements at a specific index
- How to sort and access elements in a list by index
